# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: object oriented programming is a programming langauge that was designed to deal with the complexity of larger software systems. Its different from other functional programming because as the program itself is object oriented and its designed that way to prevent a domino effect when an error occurs within a scope of code.

Researched answer: oop is a prgramming language that was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the 1990s. when web applications grow in size and become more complex, its difficult to maintain. To prevent this from happening OOP is created so that programs can be created in a set of containers so that data can become more dynamic and manipulated without haveing the entire program become disrupted in a ripple affect. 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: the difference between a float and an integer is that integers when applying mathematical operations cannot return a remainder if the number is not a whole number. 

Researched answer: In order to pass a non whole number in ruby you must apply a decimal for any numbeer that will be divided to return a number with a remainder. This is the process of float in Ruby. Integers cannot return a decimal despite being able to do mathematical operations.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: an implicit return is when a method doesnt have the keyword return but is still able to return an ouptut. In ruby an implicit return will return the last valued as an implied return by dafault.

Researched answer: implicit return is a return in a method that isnt specified but is implied. In ruby a method that doesnt contain a return will out the last value by dault as if it was implied as a return. its best practice to label to specific return that you want to output.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: ruby blocks is a anonymous form of a function to pass additional information to a method to create an output. You can identify them with the key words do/end

Researched answer: a ruby block is an anonymous form of a function that is added to a method to create additional infmormation to modify the outcome of the methods output. Its syntax is variable followed by the additional method followed by the keyword do. and can require pipes | | to addin parameters. The ruby block ends with the keyword end at the bottom of the method.

5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer: an object is an instance of a class or an example/representation of a class. An instance variable is an instance of an object or a example or representation of an object.
